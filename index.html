        <h2>About</h2>
          <p>At Milne4 we provide a whole house approach to energy saving and energy generation.</p>
          <p>As a fully qualified Retrofit Assessor under PAS2035 all surveys will be government backed by Trustmark, the highest standards in the domestic retrofit industry.</p>
          <p>We are not tied to specific products or manufacturers, so any energy saving measures we recommend will be right for you and your home.</p>
          <p>Depending on your circumstances, many of the measures we recommend will be subject to total or partial funding under new ECO3 (Energy Company Obligation) Scheme or Subsidised by monthly payments once installed by the RHI. (Renewable Heat Incentive)</p>

        <h2>Funding</h2>
          <h3>RHI</h3>
            <p>The Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (Domestic RHI) is a government financial incentive to promote the use of renewable heat. Switching to heating systems that use eligible energy sources can help the UK reduce its carbon emissions and meet its renewable energy targets.</p>
            <p>People who join the scheme and stick to its rules receive quarterly payments for seven years for the amount of clean, green renewable heat itâ€™s estimated their system produces.</p>
            <p>Since opening in April 2014, the scheme has already seen thousands of people successfully join and receive payments.</p>
          
          <hr>

          <h3>ECO Funding</h3>
            <p>Under ECO, medium and larger energy suppliers fund the installation of energy efficiency measures in British households.</p>
            <p>Each obligated supplier has an overall target based on its share of the domestic energy market in Britain.</p>
            <p>The obligated energy suppliers work with installers to introduce certain efficiency measures into your home, such as loft or wall insulation, or heating measures.</p>
            <p>The ECO3 scheme consists of one distinct obligation: the Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation (HHCRO).</p>

          <h3>Retrofit Assessment</h3>
            <p>Whole House Retrofit is a complete approach to making homes more energy efficient.</p>
            <p>It maps out a journey for each property that includes strategies for improving insulation, ventilation and heating efficiency, and is fundamental to achieving PAS2030 and PAS2035 standards for energy efficiency in buildings.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Technical Survey</h3>
            <p>Should You decide to explore any energy saving measures in more detail we can move straight to a more invasive technical survey, that will in turn be passed on to an available retrofit coordinator and eventually our chosen PAS 2030 compliant installer.</p> 
            <p>This will flag any potential issues, such as existing damp, access, or indeed the potential for any issues to arise if we are recommending more than one measure.</p>
            <p>By adhering to these standards we ensure your installation will comply with ECO funding regulations.</p>
